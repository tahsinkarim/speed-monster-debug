        What is the difference between Local storage and Session Storage ?
      </h3>
      <p class="answer">
        Local Storage is Shared between all tabs and windows from the same
        origin and The data does not expire. It remains after the browser
        restart and even OS reboot.
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        Session storage exists only within the current browser tab. Another tab
        with the same page will have a different storage. The data survives page
        refresh, but not closing/opening the tab.

        Difference between Global scope and Block scope ?
      </h3>
      <p class="answer">
        Scope determines the visibility or accessibility of a variable or other
        resource in the area of your code.
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        <strong>Global Scope:</strong> The area outside all the functions is
        consider the global scope and the variables defined inside the global
        scope can be accessed and altered in any other scopes.
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        <strong>Block Scope:</strong> A block scope is the area within if,
        switch conditions or for and while loops. Generally speaking, anythings
        between curly brackets is a block. In ES6, const and let keywords allow
        developers to declare variables in the block scope.

      <h3 class="question green">How does JavaScript event loop work ?</h3>
      <p class="answer">
        An event loop is something that pulls stuff out of the queue and places
        it onto the function execution stack whenever the function stack becomes
        empty. The event loop is the secret by which JavaScript gives us an
        illusion of being multithreaded even though it is single-threaded. It
        takes the first event from the Event Queue and places it onto the stack.
        From here, this function executes calling other functions inside it, if
        any. This cycle is called the event loop and this how JavaScript manages
        its events.

      <ul class="answer list-container">
        <li>Accessing a variable that has not been initialized first.</li>
        <li>Accessing a non-existing property of an object</li>
        <li>
          A function that doesn't have a return statement implicitly returns
          undefined.
        </li>
        <li>When you call the function and don't pass all the arguments</li>
        <li>
          When a function has a return statement without an expression, it also
          returns undefined
        </li>
        <li>Trying to access an array element outside index range</li>
        <li>Deleting an array item using delete operator</li>
