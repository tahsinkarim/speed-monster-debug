        What is the difference between Local storage and Session Storage ?
      </h3>
      <p class="answer">
        Local Storage is Shared between all tabs and windows from the same
        origin and The data does not expire. It remains after the browser
        restart and even OS reboot.
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        Session storage exists only within the current browser tab. Another tab
        with the same page will have a different storage. The data survives page
        refresh, but not closing/opening the tab.
